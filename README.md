# SDN_POX_Controller-Load_Balancer

Software Defined Networks have changed the way networks operate. The traditional computer networks consisted of expensive network devices. One such device that is used to perform a network function is a load balancer. A load balancer distributes client requests between servers.

The algorithm is based on the least bandwidth of a server at a particle time. Servers will the send the bandwidth information on a timely configured basis through a wireless network to the controller and the controller will use this information to calculate the most suitable server. The application is built on the POX controller based on python.
